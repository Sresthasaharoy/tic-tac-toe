# tic-tac-toe
The Tic Tac Toe project is a web-based implementation of the classic two-player game, designed to be played in a browser environment. Comprising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project encapsulates the essence of simplicity and interactivity. The fundamental goal is to create an engaging user interface, allowing players to take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid, with the objective of achieving a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal alignment of their chosen symbol (‘X’ or ‘O’). The HTML structure sets the stage, organizing the game content into meaningful sections. The inclusion of metadata and the viewport tag enhances compatibility across various devices and browsers. The game container, composed of individual cells, is implemented using div elements, each uniquely identified with a ‘data-cell-index’ attribute. This facilitates tracking the position of each cell within the overall grid.
